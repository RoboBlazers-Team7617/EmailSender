Hello!

My name is [name], and I am a student member of Team #7617, the Roboblazers, in the First Robotics Competition.

I wanted to share some information with you about our robotics team! We are interested in developing a partnership with your organization.

Because of our generous sponsors such as NASA, Inmac, Midwest Eye Institute, Fanfare, Eli Lilly and Co, IVM Auto, we've been able to compete in international competitions for robotics. In our most recent season, we had the honor of competing at the World's Competition in Detroit where we won the Rookie All-Star Award. We would love to have your organization added to our list of generous sponsors!

Starting in January, we had six weeks to design, build, and program a 4ft tall, 120 lb robot before competition. Over this “build season” students are hands-on as they learn about trade offs (speed vs. weight), how to CAD parts for the robot, basic tool and machining use, problem-solving, sensor uses, wiring, and programming.

FIRST is about more than just robots! We’re learning how to work as a team, problem-solve, and build leadership skills. The program also helps us work on business management and finances. We learn how to build our team just as one would build a brand. This is an example of how the FIRST program impacts students. Please see the link below for a short video to learn more about how the things we build are more than just robots.

We would love to have you as a sponsor, and we will promote your organization as a way of giving back and showing our appreciation for your support.

Please see below, as I've attached our Fundraising Plan, which has more information on Sponsor Benefits and what our team is all about. If you do decide that your organization would like to sponsor our team, I would be more than happy to provide you with more information on how to donate.

Thank you for your consideration, and hope to hear more from you soon!
