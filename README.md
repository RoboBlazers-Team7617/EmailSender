# Email Sender
This sends sponsorship emails from a text file about 13x faster than a human can! </br>
<h1>Installation</h1>
For set-up, make sure python is installed.
To grant access to the api, follow this <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps">link</a> and make sure "less secure" is toggled on!
The message.txt file contains the message you'd like to send to the potential-sponsor. There is generally no need to edit this file if you'd like to use the default message. The contacts.txt file contains the address of the recipients for the mile. There is no need for spaces or commas or anything. To get a .txt file from google docs, just go to File>Download>Plain Txt (.txt) and rename the file to message.txt. All files must be in the same directory
<h1>Run Program</h1>
To run the program, type python3 send_email.py in the directory of the project
